## Gallery

Gallery is a simple Sinatra app that sort of just fills a purpose for me- I have a big folder of images (with subdirs) that I needed to be able to link to and have slideshows. So Sinatra takes the params as a path and feeds the right information to the javascript in the template, and makes thumbnails if necessary. 

If you'd like to use it, feel free. If you'd like to contribute, or have suggestions or requests, feel free to hit me up on twitter ([@photomattmills](http://twitter.com/#!/photomattmills)).
